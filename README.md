ARTIS NFC Demo
===

This Android App allows to use NFC smartcards of Infineon's [Blockchain Security 2Go starter kit](https://www.infineon.com/blockchain) with the [ARTIS blockchain network](https://artis.eco).  
It runs on devices with Android 7.0+ and with NFC.

Via NFC the App can show balances of cards and send native tokens (ATS) and ERC-20 tokens held by cards.  

For more information about the card, see the [BlockchainSecurity 2Go github repository](https://github.com/Infineon/blockchain).

Thanks to [coinfinity](http://coinfinity.co/) for developing and open sourcing the [underlying example App](https://github.com/Infineon/BlockchainSecurity2Go-Android).
